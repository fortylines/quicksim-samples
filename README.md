Sample Verilog modules and testbenches fully implemented in a single file.

Each file can be easily simulated on the command line. ex:

    $ iverilog 4-bit-ripple-carry-adder.v
    $ ./a.out

Interactive Waveforms
---------------------

All testbenches are using a defaut _$dumpvars_ statement so you can as easily
copy/paste any sample integrated digital circuit into
[fortylines quicksim](https://fortylines.com/quicksim/) and browse the resulting
waveform on the web. Here some simulation traces already available:

- [4-bit-ripple-carry-adder.v](https://fortylines.com/quicksim/1170986439)
- [4-bit-carry-look-ahead-adder.v](https://fortylines.com/quicksim/1551577163)
